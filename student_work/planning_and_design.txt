Part I: Planning & Design (15 pts)

* Decide on a game idea and core goal
* Game rules and player actions are written or sketched out
* Main objects (player, obstacles, goals, enemies, etc.) are identified
* Sketch a simple plan showing how the game will work step-by-step
* Identify which icons you are going to use and get the unicode for those icons
* Determine your board size
* Determine your scoring system
* Determine win / lose conditions
* Outline expansion ideas

Game Idea:
Snake?
NO PLATFORMERS AS THEY NEED PHYSICS

Game Rules:
#-Don't run into the walls
#-Don't run into your own body
#-Don't run into obstacles

Major Game Elements:
#-5x5 board size
#-Snake
#-Food (emojis) --> apples, etc.
#-Scoring system: Every square survived is one point. Max score is every square (25 points for 25 square board size)

Gameplay Process:
# You start off with only one square size snake body, then move around with the arrows on your keyboard in order to "eat" randomly\
# appearing apples/food/emojis. Everytime you run into/eat one successfully, you grow by one square. Throughout this, you try to avoid
# running into yourself or the walls. You win by filling in every square.
